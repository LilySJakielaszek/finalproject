### Data Access 

(A) .Rmd Line numbers where at least two different data sources are imported:
1. FinalProjectRMD = Lines 19-21 for OccupationProjections from Data.World, lines 25-27 for three datasets from Kaggle
2. FinalProjectData RMD = Lines 16-19 for Data.World dataset, lines 21-25 for three datasets from Kaggle
(B) .Rmd Line numbers for inspecting data intake:
1. FinalProject RMD = Lines 35-53 for all four datasets nrow and ncol/ lines 76-97 for all four datasets glimpse and stating the number of cases in each dataset
2. FinalProjectData RMD = Lines 103-108 for str,nrow,head,tail for OccupationProjections, Lines 111-116 for str,nrow,head,tail for DegreesThatPayBack, Lines 119-124 for str,nrow,head,tail for SalariesByCollegeType, Lines 127-132 for str,nrow,head,tail for SalariesByRegion

### Data Wrangling

(A) .Rmd Line number(s) for general data wrangling:
(B) .Rmd Line number(s) for a join operation:
(D) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of regular expressions:
(E) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of reduction and/or transformation functions: 
(F) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of user-defined functions:

### Data Visualization

(A) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of mulitple different geoms:
(B) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of multiple aesthetics:
(C) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of layered graphics:

### For us only delete later
(A) All data visualizations must be relevant to the stated research question, and the report must include at
least one effective display of many–at least 3–variables

(B) Code quality: Code formatting is consistent with Style Guide Appendix of DataComputing eBook.
Specifically, all code chunks demonstrate proficiency with (1) meaningful object names (2) proper use
of white space especially with respect to infix operators, chain operators, commas, brackets/parens, etc (3) use of <- assignment operator throughout (4) use of meaningful comments.

(C) Narrative quality: The narrative text (1) clearly states one research question that motivates the overall
analysis, (2) explains reasoning for each significant step in the analysis and it’s relationship to the
research question, (3) explains significant findings and conclusions as they relate to the research question,
and (4) is completely free of errors in spelling and grammar

(D) Overall Quality: Submitted project shows significant effort to produce a high-quality and thoughtful
analysis that showcases STAT 184 skills. (2) The project must be self-contained, such that the analysis
can be entirely rerun without errors. (3) Analysis is coherent, well-organized, and free of extraneous
content such as data dumps, unrelated graphs, and other content that is not overtly connected to the
research question.

(E) EXTRA CREDIT (1) Project is submitted as a self-contained GitHub Repo (2) project submission is a
functioning github.io webpage generated for the project Repo. Note: a link to the GitHub Repo itself
will be awarded partial credit, but does not itself qualify as a “webpage” of the analysis.
